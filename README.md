These are the slides and code to generate the figures from my talk about Digital Signal Processing in Hadoop.

The files are:

* `signal processing in hadoop.pdf` - Slides from the talk.
* `generate-plots.R` - Produces (pretty much) all of the plots in the presentation.
* `toeplitz_filter.jl` - Julia function to create a matrix used for FIR filters.
